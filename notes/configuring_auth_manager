In Airflow 3.x, the auth manager is the component responsible for handling authentication and authorization
for the Airflow webserver and API. Think of it as the “gatekeeper” that decides who can log in and what they can do.

# Add below lines in Airflow.cfg file
[core]
simple_auth_manager_users = admin:admin
simple_auth_manager_all_admins = True

[webserver]
authenticate = True

# Run the API server on port 9001
airflow api-server --port 9001 -D

#Start the scheduler, In another terminal:
airflow scheduler -D

3. Open Airflow UI -Visit:
http://localhost:9001
